# Hospital-Dashboard
This project simulates real-world NHS Informatics work by analyzing A&amp;E (Accident &amp; Emergency) performance data using SQL, SQLite, Python, and Power BI. It demonstrates how healthcare data can be stored, queried, and visualized to track critical KPIs such as patient flow and 4-hour target compliance.
